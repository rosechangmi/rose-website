Rose Chang is currently working as a lab manager at the [Computational Clinical Science Lab](https://ccs-lab.github.io/) directed by Dr. Woo-Young Ahn and a research assistant at the [Eating Anxiety Treatment Lab](http://www.louisvilleeatlab.com/) directed by Dr. Cheri A. Levinson.

She is interested in understanding the underlying mechanisms of psychiatric disorders, particularly those of anxiety and eating disorders, for the development of a more effective and individualized treatment. After gaining relevant experience, she plans to continue her journey by pursuing a PhD in clinical psychology.

In her free time, Rose enjoys weight lifting and listening to jazz.
